## Installation
Penguin Fitness is an easy-to-use, in-browser fitness tracking app. No installations are required.
## Usage 

Navigate to the igloo, and start using it! Everything except the giant "Write Workout Name Here" form should be hidden. Once you type in the name of your workout, a button will appear in the middle of the screen. Click that button, and a form to input the name of an exercise, the number of reps for the exercise, and a description will appear. Then, your exercise list will be populated at the bottom of the page. Penguin Fitness remembers your workouts, so whenever you click the workout button, you can view all the exercises in that workout. If you wish to make a new workout, simply fill out the new workout form field again, click the button for the workout, and type in your exercises. Stay warm this winter by working out with Penguin Fitness!

## Future Development
I will absolutely work on the look of Penguin Fitness if I ever want to show this off. Just happy I got the mongoDB to work. Other future goals include full CRUD functionality and a cool logo.
